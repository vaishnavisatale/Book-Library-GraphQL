	<h2>Greetings to the GraphQL-powered Library Project!</h2>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>In this article, I’ll explain the way of integrating GraphQL API with Spring Boot application and
			performing create, read, and delete operations on MySQL Database. Here, I’m going to implement GraphQL
			query, mutation, and the way of handling GraphQL exceptions.</p>

		<h4>What is API?</h4>

		<p>API is an Application Programming Interface, which is a way to communicate between different software
			services over the internet. Different types of APIs are used in programming hardware and software,
			including operating system APIs, remote APIs, and web APIs. A web API or web service API is a set of
			tools that allow developers to send and receive instructions and data between a web server and a web
			browser, usually in JSON format, to build applications.</p>

		<h4>What is GraphQL?</h4>

		<p>Simply put, GraphQL is an open-source query language for APIs that allows you to fetch and manipulate
			your data. Its functionality is most similar to the REST API, and architecturally, it has more
			improvements than REST.</p>

		<h4>Why do we use GraphQL over traditional REST API?</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>Over and under-fetching data is avoided.</li>
			<li>Queries return predictable results.</li>
			<li>Apps are fast and stable because the server isn’t controlling the data.</li>
			<li>Network and memory usage decrease with less bandwidth.</li>
			<li>Frontend or service consumer developers do not want to depend on backend developer works and no need
				to handle versioning of rest endpoints.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>What are the GraphQL Operation Types?</h4>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Query:</strong> Used to fetch/read data.</li>
			<li><strong>Mutation:</strong> Used to create, update, and delete data/manipulate data.</li>
			<li><strong>Subscription:</strong> Like queries, subscriptions enable you to fetch data. Unlike queries,
				they change their result over time. Subscriptions are useful for notifying your client in real time
				about changes to back-end data, such as the creation of a new object or updates to an important
				field.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>What is a schema?</h4>

		<p>It is the entry point for the application and the place where we specify our GraphQL data types, queries,
			and mutations. It has a ".graphqls" file extension.</p>

		<h4>What is a resolver?</h4>

		<p>In our application, you can see query resolver and mutation resolver. It's responsible for mapping the
			schema and data model in our application. A resolver is the key architectural component that connects
			GraphQL fields, graph edges, queries, mutations, and subscriptions to their respective data sources.</p>



		<h2>Objective</h2>

		<p>The goal of this example is to build GraphQL APIs to perform CRUD operations with the MySQL database.
			This exercise is around post and comment data API, and each post has many comments. I have used
			One-to-Many relationships here.</p>

		<h2>Technology</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>Spring Boot 2.7.8.RELEASE (with Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and mysql-connector)</li>
			<li>graphql-spring-boot-starter</li>
			<li>Maven build tool</li>
		</ul>
